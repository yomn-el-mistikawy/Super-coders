		<h1><u>Adel Zee' profile!</u></h1>
		<h3><strong>Hi there</strong></h3>
		<p>My name is Adel Zain. I'm also referred to as Adel Badawy, Adel el Shaikh, and many others, but the most common thing people call me is Zee. Adel Zee. Zee is basically a nickname derived from Zain. How and why was it derived from Zain is a long story and I don't want to bore you with the details. :)</p>
		<h3><strong>What do I do?</strong></h3>
		<p>Well, my favorite thing to do is singing. I love singing, like no other. I began singing shortly before entering college, but all the music I did was at home, within the confines of the 4 walls of my room. I never would have guessed I was a capable singer, since I pretty much only sang covers and never really put much effort into it. I wouldn't say I make originals now, but I can definitely tell you that the Zee that used to sing 4 or 5 years ago has developed much much more, thanks to a whole lot of opportunities that I have been exposed to. Anyway, enough with that, too many boring details again. What else, what else.. Ah yes! I love coding. I don't do it as often as you'd think someone who loves coding does, but I absolutely love it. The idea that I can create a code and see an instant outcome. If you've read this far, then I'm impressed. I really did not expect anyone to do that. Anyway, enough of this for now.</p>
		<h3><strong>So what now?</strong></h3>
